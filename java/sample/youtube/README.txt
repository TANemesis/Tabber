Google YouTube Data API Java Samples - README.txt
-------------------------------------------------

The Java YouTube samples are simple applications that show sample usage
of the various feeds that comprise the YouTube Data API. One of the samples
is a readonly sample that allows anonymous searching of the feeds. The other
sample is an authenticated sample that performs write or upload operations
on behalf of a user.

The application can be built and run using the provided Ant build file found at
gdata/java/build-samples.xml.  The sample can be run in the following manner:

1.  Invoke the samples using the appropriate commandline:

    ant -f gdata/java/build-samples.xml sample.youtube.read.run

    or

    ant -f gdata/java/build-samples.xml sample.youtube.write.run
